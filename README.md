# Specific Tasks to Complete the Project:
1. A pendulum is made of a rope and a bob. The bob is the weight attached at the end of the pendulum.
2. You can reuse the paper class created on Project C24 for this project.
Copy the whole class, add it to the current project and rename it to bob
Make sure you also include this class in index.html
3. Make a roof class
The roof is nothing but the ground placed at a height.
We have created a ground class in Project C24, which can be reused and included in this project.
Make sure you also include this roof class in index.html
4. Reuse the Chain class created during your class and rename it to rope
Make sure you also include this rope class in index.html.
5. Create five bob objects bobObject1, bobObject2, bobObject3, bobObject4, bobObject5.
These are arranged horizontally as shown in the image below
Keep these objects some distance away from the roof. 200 pixels would be a good starting value to try.
